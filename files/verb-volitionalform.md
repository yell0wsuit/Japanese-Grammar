# The Volitional Form
 ---
The volitional form of a verb has the same meaning as the [mashou-form](verb-masyou) and is used for suggesting activities or things to do. 

The volitional form is, however, less polite than the mashou-form and more likely to be used between close friends. Want to suggest going for a drink with that special someone? Then this is the conjugation for you! 

## Conjugating the Volitional Form
  
### U-verbs (Group I)
Take the dictionary form, and change the last kana from the う-line sound to the お-line sound. Finally, add `う`.

|Dictionary Form|Volitional Form|
|:--|:--|
|[行く](1578850)|行こう|
|[会う]()|会おう|
|[話す]()|話そう|
|[買う]()|買おう|

### Ru-verbs (Group II)
Ru-verbs are pretty friendly towards conjugators. Take the dictionary form, remove the final `る` and add `よう`.
  
|Dictionary Form|Volitional Form|

|[見る]()|見よう|
|[食べる]()|食べよう|

## Questions in the Volitional Form
Statements in the volitional form can be made into questions using rising inflexion or the particle か. 

While most informal forms of speech do not use the particle か to form a question (they rely on inflexion), the volitional form is an exception to this rule, and it is not considered rude or too direct to create a question using the particle か, e.g.

> [今日は何をしようか]()   
> (What would you like to do today?)

## Example Sentences:
> [君に免じて彼を許そう。]()   
> Let's forgive him.
  
#
 
> [外に出ようよ。]()  
> Let's go outside.
  
#
 
> [さてどうしよう。]()   
> What shall I do now?
