# The Plain Form
 ---
The plain-form can be used instead of the [masu-form](verb-longformpresentaffirmative) in most casual situations. It is also used within sentences to create compounds, no matter whether the sentence itself is in plain-form, or in a more formal form.

The basic formations of the plain-form are these:

||Affirmative|Negative|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Non-past|Dictionary-form|Nai-form|
|Past|Ta-form|Nakatta-form|

As you can see, there are only two tenses to learn in the above table. Non-past (i.e. present & future) and past. Unlike English and most romantic languages, Japanese verbs do not conjugate based on their subject and remain unaffected whether 'I', 'you', 'he', 'she' or 'they' is the subject.
