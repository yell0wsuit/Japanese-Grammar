# Liking and Disliking

Two of the most important na-adjectives in the Japanese language are [好き]() and [きらい](), meaning like and dislike respectively. 

Counter to what you might expect, the words 'like' and 'dislike' in Japanese are adjectives, and not verbs as they are in English. 

## Using 好き and きらい
The basic format of a sentence using `好き` or `きらい` is this:

> **Topic** は **Subject** が　**好き/きらい** です。

For example: 
> [オスカーさんは寿司が好きです。]()  
> Oscar likes sushi.

#

> [ベンさんは焼酎がきらいです。]()  
> Ben dislikes shochu

#

If you use `好き` when talking about another person, be careful, as in Japanese, it is often taken to mean that you have some form of romantic interest in that person. You know, 'I *like* like you'.

`好き` and `きらい` can also be paired with nouns to create 'liked' or 'disliked' things:

> [好きな音楽]()  
> liked music

#

> [きらいな食べ物]()  
> disliked foods


If you really want to emphasise what you like or dislike, you can combine [好き]() and [きらい]() with [大]() to create the words [大好き]() and [大きらい](). These are also na-adjectives.

## Example Sentences:
> [好きでもきらいでもありません。]()  
> I neither like it nor dislike it.

#

> [彼女はオレンジが好きですか。]()  
> Does she like oranges?

#

> [太陽が大好きです。]()  
> I like the sun.

#

> [自分の文を友だちに訳してもらうのが好きだ。]()  
> I like when my friends translate my sentences.

#

> [猫は水が嫌いです。]()  
> Cats don't like water.

#

> [私は本当に乳製品が大嫌いです]()  
> I really hate dairy products.

#

> [嫌いな飲み物は何ですか。]()  
> Which drinks don't you like?
