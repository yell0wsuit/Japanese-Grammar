# Giving and Receiving

In Japanese there are two words for the English 'to give': `あげる` and `くれる`. Which word you use depends on the direction of giving. 

If someone gives something to someone else, `あげる` is used, for example:

> [私はお父さんにシャツをあげる。]()  
> I will give my father a shirt.

If someone is given something by someone else, `くれる` is used. For example:

> [お父さんは私にシャツをくれる。]()  
> My father will give me a shirt.

With both verbs the sentence structure is as follows:

> Giver **は/が** recipient **に** あげる/くれる

## もらう
If you want to say someone received something from someone else, the verb `もらう` is used. When using `もらう` the particle order of the sentence is reversed, and the sentence structure looks like this:

> Recipient **は/が** giver **に/から** もらう

For example: 

> [私はお父さんにシャツをもらう。]()    
> I will receive a shirt from my father.

The giver can be marked by the particle `に` or the particle `から`. `から` is more appropriate than `に` if the giver is a non-human entity, such as a company or the government. 

> [私は私の会社からお金をもらった。]()   
> I received some money from my company.

## Notes
When choosing between `あげる`, `くれる` and `もらう`, there are a few things to bear in mind.

1. When two people of no relation to the speaker are giving something to one another, the verb to use is usually `あげる` rather than `くれる`. `くれる` is only used in this situation if 'the giving' is of some benefit to you or your immediate family. 
2. `もらう` cannot be used to ask questions along the lines of 'did you receive something from me?'. In `もらう` sentences, the giver cannot be `私`.
3. If the subject of any of the sentence is the speaker, `私は` can often be omitted as long as the sentence does not become to ambiguous.
