# Courtesy Titles in Japanese

The Japanese language has a number of different courtesy titles which are dependent on occupation, setting and context. Some of these translate well into English, and others have no direct translation.

Unlike in English where titles precede a name, Japanese titles act as suffixes to the name.

## さん
`さん` loosely translates to Mr., Mrs., Ms., Mx. `さん` is attached to the family name of a person. In Japanese writing and conversation, the family name precedes the given name, and is usually the preferred name amongst acquaintances. You never refer to yourself as `さん`

## 様
`様` also translates to Mr., Mrs., Ms., Mx., but is more polite than `さん`. You will hear it used by staff in shops, hotels etc. when addressing customers. 

## 氏
`氏` translates to Mr., Mrs., Ms., Mx., but is usually used to refer to public figures or professional people. It is used most commonly in writing. 

## 君
`くん` has no direct translation into English. It follows a family or given name and is used when addressing male friends, male children or male students. 

## ちゃん
`ちゃん` follows a given name and is used to address children, old friends and sometimes older relatives in an affectionate way.

## 先生
Most commonly used to refer to teachers/professors, but also used as a courtesy in place of `さん` when addressing doctors, lawyers, writers, politicians, etc.

## Job Titles
Companies in Japan tend to be very hierarchical, and there are clear distinctions between employees of different station. When using job titles in speech, the name is often omitted, and just the job title used.
