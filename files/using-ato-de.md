# Using 後で

`後で` translates to 'after' or 'later'. It is used in combination with nouns and verbs to say that something happened after something else.

##  後で with Verbs
` 後で` follows verbs in the plain-form, for example: 

> [焼酎を飲んだ後で、一時間ほど寝ました。]()  
> After I drank the shochu, I fell asleep for an hour.

##  後で with Nouns
When `後で` follows a noun, the particle `の` is placed between the noun and `後で`. For example:

> [昼ごはんの後で友達とコヒーを飲んだ。]()  
> After lunch, I had a coffee with my friends.

## Difference between 後で and てから
`後で` and `てから` are fairly interchangeable, but are subtly different. `てから` implies the action that follows is more dependant on the completion of action that precedes it and suggests a closer relationship in terms of time. `後で` is more applicable when a length of time occurs between activity 1 and activity 2.

## Example Sentences:
> [プールで泳いだ後でスッキリした気分になった。]()  
> I felt refreshed after a swim in the pool.

#

> [ねえ、後でアイス食べよう。]()  
> Hey, let's eat some ice cream afterwards.
