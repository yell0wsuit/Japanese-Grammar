# Transitive and Intransitive Verbs
 ---
Sometimes verbs are used to describe one thing's action upon another thing, involving a subject, and an object. These verbs are known as transitive verbs. 

The opposite is intransitive verbs, which can be used without the need of an object and mostly describe changes in state.

In Japanese, while most verbs are either transitive or intransitive, there is collection of verbs which have a counterpart verb of the opposite transitivity. These are known as transitive pairs. 

## Transitive Pairs

||Transitive||Intransitive|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|[開ける]()|to open|[開く]()|to be opened|
|[閉める]()|to close|[閉まる]()|to be closed|
|[つける]()|to turn on|[開く]()|to be turned on|
|[落とす]()|to drop|[落ちる]()|to fall|
|[出す]()|to take out|[出る]()|to enter|
|[つける]()|to attach|[つく]()|to be attached|
|[消す]()|to erase|[消える]()|to disappear|

## Usage
When constructing a sentence with a transitive verb, it is important to have three things: the subject, the object and the verb.   
  
Intransitive sentences, meanwhile, only need the object and the verb. This is because intransitive sentences describe a state of change in something without a subject necessarily having caused that change. 

Because of the difference between the two verb types, particle usage is different. Study the example sentences below to see the differences

## Example Sentences:
> Transitive: [オスカーさんが窓を開けました。]()  
> Oscar opened the windows.

#

> Intransitive: [窓が開けました。]()  
> The windows opened.

#

> Transitive: [トミさんがドアを閉めました。]()  
> Tommy opened the door.

#
 
> Intransitive: [ドアが閉まりました]()  
> The door was opened
