# The Particle も

The particle `も` has a wide range of uses, but is most commonly used to mean 'also', 'as well', 'too' or 'neither'. This article introduces a few of the uses of `も`.

## Using も for Similarity
If we have two sentences:

1. [それは犬です。]()  
That is a dog
2. [これは犬です。]()  
This is a dog

Instead of using the particle `は` to define the topic in two different sentences, we can link the two sentences using `も`, as follows:

> [それは犬です、これも犬です。]()    
> That is a dog and this is a dog, too.

### Particles with も
In the example above, `は` was simply replaced with `も`. Similarly, If the original particle used was `が`, `が` is also replaced with `も`.

Different rules exist with `で` and `に`. If the original particle was `で` or `に`, `で` and `に` both remain in place, and `も` is added afterwards to create the particles `でも` and `にも`. For example:

> **Person 1**: [日本で山がたくさんあります。]()  
> Japan has lots of mountains.    
> **Person 2**: [フランス**でも**山がたくさんあります。]()   
> France also has lots of mountains.  
  
#

> **Person 1**: [福岡に行った。]() 
> I went to Fukuoka.  
> **Person 2**: [福岡にも行った。]()
> I also went to Fukuoka.

## Using も to Express Lack of Preference
If you want to say you like both X and Y, or have no particular preference for either, use `も` as follows:

> [焼肉も焼き鳥も好きです。]()    
> I like both Yakiniku and Yakitori.

#

> [京都も東京も行きたい。]()    
> I want to go to both Tokyo and Kyoto.

## Asking Questions with も
You can use `も` in questions to ask whether someone shares the same characteristic or opinion.

> **Person 1**: [あなたも猫が好きですか。]()   
> Do you also like cats?  
> **Person 2**: [はい、猫が好きです。]()   
> Yes, I like cats.

## も with Quantity
`も` can also be used with quantities of things to emphasise their size (for better or for worse). For example, if you receive ¥50,000 you could say: 

> [５万円 貰いました。]()  
> I received ¥50,000.

However if you want to emphasise this statement, because you believe it to be a large quantity, you can say:

> [５万円も貰いました。]()  
> Wow, I received ¥50,000.

`も` can be used to emphasise both positive and negative, so if something cost you ¥5,000 and you think that it was expensive, you could say:

> [５千円もかかった。]()  
> Boo, it cost ¥5,000.

## も with Interrogative Pronouns
Japanese interrogative pronouns such as `何` `誰`, `どれ` and `どこ` can be combined with `も` to create a whole host of useful words:

|Interrogative Pronoun|+も|
|:--|:--|
|何 (what)|何も (anything/nothing)|
|誰 (who)|誰も (everyone/no one)|
|どれ (which)|どれも (both/neither)|
|どこ (where)|どこも (anywhere/nowhere)|

For example:
> [誰もがほっとしたようだった。]()  
> Everyone looked relieved.

## Using も to mean Not Even
Using the following construct, you can use `も` to mean 'not even'.

* ー + counter + も + negative verb

For example, `滴` is used as the counter for a drop of something: 一滴 means one drop. So, to create a sentence in Japanese along the lines of, 'it hasn't rained a drop' you would use `も` as follows:

> [雨が一滴も降らなかった。]()  
> It's not even rained a drop

This construct can be used with any countable unit. 

## Example Sentences:
> [私も日本人です。]()  
> I'm also Japanese

#

> [日本でもお天気がいいです。]()  
> The weather in Japan is good too.

#

> [彼も同じことを言っていた。]()  
> He was saying the same thing too.

#

> [その絵が逆さまに掛けられていることに誰も気付かなかった。]()  
> Nobody noticed that the picture was hung upside down.

#

> [私の町には外国人は一人もいません]()  
> There are no people from abroad living in my town.
