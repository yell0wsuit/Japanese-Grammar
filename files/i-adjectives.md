# I-Adjectives

As the name might suggest, all i-adjectives end with the kana `い`. I-adjectives are one of two main groups of adjectives, the other group being [na-adjectives](adjective-naform.md).  

There are a few na-adjectives that also end with `い`, `きれい` being the most common example. So how do you tell the difference between the two?

The easiest way is to delve into the kanji. When `きれい` is written in kanji `綺麗` the `い` is included in the second kanji, and is not modifiable. I-adjectives will always end with a modifiable hiragana `い`. Take a look at the list below.

## Common I-Adjectives:
> [おいしい]()  
> Delicious

#

> [高い]()  
> High/expensive

#

> [いい]()  
> Good

#

> [悪い]()  
> Bad

## Conjugating I-Adjectives
* Negative: Remove the `い` and add `くない`.
* Past-affirmative: Remove the `い` and add `かった`.
* Past-negative: Remove the `い` and add `くなかった`.

||Affirmative|Negative|
|:-- |:--|:--|
|Present|高い|高くない| 
|Past|高かった|高くなかった| 

### An Exceptional I-Adjective
There's one i-adjective that spoils the party: `いい`. The word `いい` was originally written as `よい` and hangs on to aspects of its past-self. When conjugating `いい` into the past tense, or making it negative, you must conjugate from `よい`.

||Affirmative|Negative|
|:-- |:--|:--|
|Present|いい|よくない.| 
|Past|よかった|よくなかった| 

## Modifying Nouns
To modify nouns with i-adjectives, you must conjugate the adjective first: 
 
> [高い山です。]()  
> It is a tall mountain.

#

> [高くない山です。]()  
> It is not a tall mountain.

#

> [高かった山です。]()  
> It was a tall mountain.

#

> [高くなかった山です。]()  
> It was not a tall mountain.
