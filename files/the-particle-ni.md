# The Particle に

`に` is one of the most commonly used particles in Japanese and has a wide range of uses including denoting time, location, destination and changes of state. Here we introduce some of the most common uses of the particle `に`.

## Location: に vs で
Both `に` and `で` can be used to talk about location, however, they are used in different contexts. `に` is used when talking about 'the location of being' of something e.g. 

> [福岡に住んでいます]()  
> I live in Fukuoka. 

で meanwhile is used to talk about the location of doing, combined with action verbs e.g. 

> [福岡で働いています]()  
> I work in Fukuoka.

## Change of State
`に` is used in conjunction with the verb `なる` to indicate a change of state in something, e.g. [医者になります。]() (I will become a doctor.)

## Indirect Objects
`に` usually follows indirect objects, for example:

> [友達に手紙を書きます。]()   
> I write letters to my friends.

> [彼女は僕にお箸をくれました。]()   
> She gave me a pair of chopsticks.

## Direction and Destination: に and へ
When talking about direction and destination, `に` and `へ` are fairly interchangeable.

For example, both `福岡に行きます` and `福岡へいきます` translate to 'I will go to Fukuoka'. 

Exceptions to this rule include `お風呂に入る` (to get in a bath) and `電車に乗る` (to board a bus).

In speech `へ` gives greater room for generalisations about direction or destination, while `に` tends to be used more specifically.

## Time
に is used to denote a specific time:

For example: 
> [６時半に起きました。]()     
> I got up at 6.30.

#

> [２月に福岡へ行きます。]()     
> I will go to Fukuoka in February.

#

> [2017年に日本語を勉強しました。]()   
> In 2017, I studied Japanese.

`に` is not used with the following words: `今日`, `今`, `朝`, `晩`, `いつ`, `毎`, `来`

## Times Per
`に` is also used when donating how many times something is done in a given time, translating to 'per'. For example: 

> [一週間に３回テニスをする。]()   
> I play tennis three times a/per week.
