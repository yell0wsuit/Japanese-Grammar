# Hoping Something Happens with といい

`といい` is added to the end of a sentence to mean that you hope that something positive happens. It takes on slightly different forms dependent on whether you hope something happens to yourself or to someone else

## といいですね
This is the form taken when you hope something happens for someone else. It is combined with a plain form conjugation of a verb or adjective, e.g:

> [雪が降るといいですね。]()  
> I hope it snows (for you).

#

> [ 今日は楽しかったといいですね。]()  
> I hope you had fun today.

## といいんですが
This is the form taken when you hope something happens for yourself. It is combined with a plain form conjugation of a verb or adjective, e.g:

> [ 飛行機が短くていいんですが。]()   
> I hope the flight is short.

In both cases, といい is used to say that you hope something that is out of your control happens. If the thing you hope will happen is in your control, then you cannot use this phrase.
