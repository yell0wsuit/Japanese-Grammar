# The Passive Form

The passive form is used in Japanese when something has occurred to affect the subject, without action by the subject (i.e the subject is passive). 

Unlike in English, where the passive voice is discouraged, the passive form has a strong place within Japanese speech.

## Conjugating the Passive Form

### U-Verbs
For u-verbs that end in the kana `う`, take the dictionary form, remove the `う`, replace it with `わ` and then add `れる`.

|Dictionary Form|Passive Form| 
|:--|:--|
|[買う]()|買われる|

For all other u-verbs, replace the u-vowel sound with the a-vowel equivalent and then attach `れる`.

|Dictionary Form|Passive Form| 
|:--|:--|
|[待つ]()|待たれる|　
|[飲む]()|飲まれる|　
|[泳ぐ]()|泳がれる| 

You may have noticed the first steps of conjugating the causative form follow the same pattern as conjugating the [nai-form](verb-shortformpresentnegative). Only the final step is different, adding `れる` instead of `ない`.

### Ru-Verbs
Take the dictionary form, and replace the last `る` with `られる`.

|Dictionary Form| Passive Form| 
|:--|:--|
|[信じる]()|信じられる|
|[食べる]()|食べられる|
|[寝る]()|寝られる|

## Using the Passive Form
Once you have conjugated the passive form, it can be used in the following format:

**Subject** は **Actor** に **Action**

Where the Action (verb) is conjugated into the passive form to express that the actor has performed that verb in a way that has affected the subject.  For example:

> [この手紙は彼に渡される]()  
> This letter will be given to him.

This is just one way to use the passive form, see the example sentences below for further uses.
