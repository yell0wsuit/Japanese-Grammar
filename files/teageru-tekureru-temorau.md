# Verbs + てあげる, てくれる & てもらう

`くれる`, `あげる` and `もらう` are all verbs to do with giving and receiving of things. These verbs can also be combined with other verbs in the [te-form](verb-teform) to add nuance to the expression of an action.

## てあげる
`あげる` follows a verb in its te-form when the speaker is performing an action on behalf of others. By creating the てあげる construct, the inherent meaning of a sentence is not changed, rather it becomes more nuanced: it implies that an action is performed as a favour or on the request of someone else. For example:

> [このペンが欲しいのなら、貸してあげるよ。]()  
> If you want this pen, I will lend it to you.

## てくれる
The te-form of a verb + `くれる`, by contrast, is used when another person does something on behalf of the speaker. For example:

> [彼は私たちに英語を教えてくれる。]()  
> He teaches us English.

## てもらう
The te-form of a verb + `もらう` is used when the speaker persuades, gets, or demands that another person do something for them. In te-form + `もらう` sentences, the person who is carrying out the action is marked by the particle `に`. For example: 

> [自分の文を友だちに訳してもらうのが好きだ。]()  
> I like it when I get my friends to translate my sentences.

`友達` here is the person carrying out the action, and is marked with the particle `に`.
