# Common Adverbs in Japanese
 ---
Adverbs are words or phrases that modify the meaning of an adjective, verb, or other adverb, expressing manner, place, time, or degree. Japanese has many adverbs that add specificity to sentences. This article introduces some of the most common adverbs in Japanese.

## Adverbs of Frequency
Adverbs of frequency can be added to sentences to describe how often you do something. 

### Common Adverbs of Frequency
* [毎日]() - every day
* [毎週]() - every week
* [いつも]() - always
* [よく]() -  often
* [大抵]() - usually
* [ときどき]() - sometimes
* [あまり]() - not often
* [全然]() - never

`まいにち`, `いつも`, `よく`, `たいてい`, and `ときどき` are all positive adverbs. This means that they occur with verbs conjugated in the affirmative. `あまり` and `ぜんぜん` are negative adverbs and always appear with a negatively conjugated verb. For example:

> [私は毎週うどんを食べます。]()  
> I eat udon every week.

#


> [彼女はあまりテレビを見ない]()  
> She doesn't often watch TV.

#



## Adverbs of Degree
Adverbs of degree are added to sentences to clarify whether something possesses a lot or a little of a certain characteristic.

### Common Adverbs of Degree
* [とても]() - very
* [ちょっと]() - a little

For example:
> [屋久島の海はとても綺麗です。]()  
> The sea in Yakushima is very beautiful.

#

> [このカレーはちょと辛いです。]()  
> This curry is a little spicy

#

## Adverbs of Quantity
Adverbs of Quantity are used to express whether something was performed a lot or a little. These expressions can be attached directly before a direct object, or alternatively before the verb.

### Common Adverbs of Quantity
* [たくさん]() - many/lots of
* [少し]() - few

For example: 
> [福岡でたくさん写真を撮りました。]()  
> In Fukuoka I took lots of photos.

#

> [東京で写真を少し撮りました。]()  
> In Tokyo I took few photos.

#
