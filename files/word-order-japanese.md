# Word Order in Japanese

Japanese is classified as a Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) language, while English is classified as a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language. 

This means that every Japanese sentence must end with a verb, adjective or a form of a [copula](the-various-forms-of-desu). Outside this structure, the rest of a Japanese sentence is fairly free with the exception of the sentence's topic, which comes at the very beginning of the sentence.

Between the sentence-beginning *subject* and the sentencing-ending *verb*, the position of elements such as the object, location, time or subordinate clauses can be switched. For example, both of the following sentences are correct.

> [オスカーさんは福岡で日本語を勉強しています。]()  
> Oscar is studying Japanese in Fukuoka.

#

> [オスカーさんは日本語を福岡で勉強しています。]()  
> Oscar is studying Japanese in Fukuoka.

You will notice that in both cases the subject (オスカーさん) and the verb (勉強する) remain in the same place.

## Modifier Precedes Modified
Another rule of Japanese syntax is that modifying words precedes words that are to be modified. For example in describing the color of an object, the color precedes the object: 

> [青い物 ]()  
> a blue thing

## Sentence-Ending Particles
In addition to the basic SOV word order, many sentences have additional appendages in the form of sentence-ending particles such as `か`, `ね` or `よ`. These particles are used to emphasise the meaning of a sentence in some way and do not otherwise interfere with the syntax of a sentence. You can read more about sentence-ending particles in [this article](ending-statements-with-ne-and-yo).
