# Making Requests in Japanese Using the Te-Form

It's easy to make requests in Japanese once you know the [te-form]() by combining verbs in the te-form with the word `下さい`.

For example: 
> [お箸を取って下さい。]()  
> Please can you pass me a pair of chopsticks.

Using this format is essentially the same as saying to someone in English, "Please can you ... (for me)?" 

## Requests in the Negative
If you would like to request some to refrain from doing something, then you can use the negative variation `ないで下さい`. To use this form, simply conjugate a verb to its [nai-form](verb-shortformpresentnegative) and then and `で下さい`. For example:

> [ここでコーヒーを飲まないで下さい。]()  
> Please don't drink coffee here.

## Polite Requests
To take your request up a notch in politeness, you can substitute `下さい` with `いただけませんか`. This is more appropriate when asking something of a stranger or non-peer.

> [お箸を取っていただけませんか。]()   
> Please can you pass me a pair of chopsticks. (polite)

## Alternatives
Equivalent in politeness to `て下さい` is `てくれませんか`. A more casual form of `てくれませんか` is `てくれない`.

> [お箸を取ってくれませんか。]()   
> Please can you pass me a pair of chopsticks.

#

> [お箸を取ってくれない。]()   
> Please can you pass me a pair of chopsticks. (casual)
