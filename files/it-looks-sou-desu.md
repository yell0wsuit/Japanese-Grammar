# It Looks ... with そうです

If you want to say something looks delicious, or the weather seems fine, or a Japanese book looks easy, `そうです` is the expression for you.

## Conjugating Adjectives
The following table demonstrates the conjugation rules for i-adjectives and na-adjectives:

||Plain-form|+そうです|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**I-adjectives**|[おいしい]()|おいしそうです|
|Irregular i-adjective|[いい]()|よさそうです|
|**Na-adjectives**|[便利な]()|便利そうです|

With i-adjectives, you must cut the final `い` kana before adding `そうです` and with na-adjectives, you must remove the `な`

`おいしそう` (it looks delicious) is one of the most common phrases you'll hear in a Japanese restaurant, or when watching a Japanese cooking show, or doing anything food related in Japan. It's a good one to know. 

## Negative Adjectives and そうです
The construct can be made with negative adjectives too, to say that things do not look or seem. The conjugations are as follows:

||Plain-form|+そうです|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Negative I-adjectives**|おいしくない|おいしくなさそうです|
|**Negative Na-adjectives**|綺麗じゃない|綺麗じゃなさそうです|

In both cases, the `い` of `ない` is cut and replaced with `さ` before `そうです` is added.

## Qualifying Nouns with Adjectives + そうな
Nouns can be qualified with an adjective plus `そうな` to say that the noun looks or seems a certain way. For example:

> [難しそうな漢字です]()  
> A difficult looking kanji.

When `そう` is combined with an adjective, the resulting compound is itself a na-adjective, hence the need for `な` following `そう`.

## Using そうです with Verbs
If you want to use `そうです` with a verb, you must conjugate the verb to its stem before adding `そうです`.
