# The Particle へ

`へ` is a particle used to indicate direction or destination. 

Despite being written as the kana `へ`, `へ` the particle is pronounced the same as the kana `え`

## Differences Between に and へ
When talking about direction and destination, に and へ are fairly interchangeable.

For example, both `福岡に行きます` and `福岡へいきます` translate to 'I will go to Fukuoka'. 

Exceptions to this rule include `お風呂に入る` (to get in a bath) and `電車に乗る` (to board a bus), where `に` is always used and not `へ`.

In speech `へ` gives greater room for generalisations about direction or destination, while `に` tends to be used more specifically.
