# Going Place to Do Things (に行く)

With [verb stems](verb-iform) you can create compounds with verbs of motion such as `行く` and `来る`. 

With this construction you can create sentences such as 'to go to a place to do X' or 'to come to a place to do X'

## Verb stem + に行く
Take a verb in the dictionary form, such as `買う`, and conjugate it to its stem, `買い`. Then add `に行く` to create the phrase `買いに行く` (go to buy).

In the above sentence `行く` can be further conjugated to change the sentence to the polite form `買いに行きます`, past tense `買いに行った` or any number of variations to create more complex sentences.

## Verb stem + に来る
This compound follows the same model as above, but means 'come to do something' rather than 'go to do something'. 

> [朱抹、妹が会いに来る。]()  
> My younger sister is coming to meet me at the weekend.

Again, the final verb, `来る`, can be conjugated to change the tense of the sentence and create more complicated constructs.

## The Particle に
In both cases, the particle `に` is used to imply coming or going for the purpose of doing something.

## Using に行く
The basic format of the sentence is this:
**Destination** (に/へ) **purpose** (に) **行く/くる/帰る**

1. **Destination** refers to the place (Fukuoka, Tokyo, Beach, Pool). 

2. **Purpose** can be a noun such as `勉強` or a verb. If the purpose is a verb, it must be in its stem form.

3. **行く/くる/帰る** can be used depending on the location of the speaker relative to the destination.

## Example Sentences:
> [彼は時々会いに来る。]()   
> He comes to see me once in a while.

#

> [一緒に食べに行きましょう。]()
