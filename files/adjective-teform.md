# Adjectives: The Te-Form

Adjectives can be combined by conjugating them to the te-form. The te-form of an adjective can be conjugated as follows:

## I-Adjectives
With i-adjectives, simply remove the final `い` and then add `くて`. If the adjective is to be conjugated from the negative, cut the `い` of the `くない` and add `くて`.

||plain form|te-form|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Affirmative|高い|高くて|
|Negative|高くない|高くなくて|

## Na-Adjectives
To conjugate affirmative na-adjectives to the te-form, simply use the plain form (minus `な` or `だ`) and then add `で`.

Negative na-adjectives meanwhile, conjugate like i-adjectives, by cutting the `い` of `ない` and adding `くて`

||plain form|te-form|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Affirmative|元気|元気で|
|Negative|元気じゃない|元気じゃなくて|

## Connecting the Adjectives
Once in the te-form, adjectives can be connected to make compounds such as:
* 美味しくて安い (delicious and cheap)
* 元気で親切 (energetic and kind)

An important point to note when combining adjectives like this, is that the feeling of the adjectives cannot be opposing (i.e. one adjective describing the thing negatively, and the other positively). 

For example, describing something as delicious but expensive (美味しくて高い) would be considered incorrect, as one adjective implies a positive characteristic and one a negative characteristic. 

Two positives, ok. Two negatives, ok. A negative and a positive, problematic.
