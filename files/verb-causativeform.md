# The Causative Form
 ---
The causative form is used to describe when someone or something has made something happen or, as the name suggests, causes something to happen.

## Using the Causative Form
Sentences in the causative form usually need a causer, an actor and an action. 

Take the following sentence:  

> [お母さんは子供に果物を食べさせました。]()    
> The mother made the child eat the fruit.

The causer (`お母さん`) is marked by the particle `は` or `が`, the actor (子供) is marked by the particle `に` and the verb is conjugated to the causative form.

## Conjugation the Causative Form

### U-Verbs
For u-verbs that end in the kana `う`, take the dictionary form, remove the `う`, replace it with `わ` and then add `せる`.

| Dictionary Form | Causative Form | 
|:--|:--|
|[買う]()|買わせる|

For all other u-verbs, replace the u-vowel sound with the a-vowel equivalent and then attach `せる`.

| Dictionary Form | Causative Form | 
|:--|:--|
|[待つ]()|待たせる|　
|[飲む]()|飲ませる|　
|[泳ぐ]()|泳がせる|
|[行く](1578850)|行かせる|  

You may have noticed the first steps of conjugating the causative form follow the same pattern as conjugating the [nai-form](shortformpresentnegative). Only the final step is different, adding `せる` instead of `ない`.

### Ru-Verbs
For ru-verbs, take the dictionary form, cut the `る` and add `させる`.

|Dictionary Form | Causative Form |
|:--|:--|
|[食べる]()|食べさせる|
|[見る]()|見させる|
|[覚える]()|覚えさせる|

### Irregular
|Dictionary Form | Causative Form |
|:--|:--|
|[する](1157170)|させる|
|[くる]()|こさせる|

Each of these verbs in the causative form are effectively new verbs in the ru-form and can be conjugated further to the te-form, masu-form etc. 

## Example Sentences:
> [アレルギーがあるのに私が子どもに卵を食べさせてしまった。]()   
> Even though she's allergic, I gave an egg to the child.

#

> [私が友達に宿題をチェックさせた。]()   
> I had my friend check my homework.

#

> [飲食代を払わせる。]()  
> To make a person pay for food.

#

> [待たせてごめんなさい。]()  
> Sorry I made you wait.
