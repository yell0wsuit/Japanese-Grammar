# The Particle と

The particle `と` has several uses in Japanese, from acting as a conjunction to allowing comparisons and contrasts to be made. This article introduces some of the uses of this crucial particle.

## Connecting nouns with と
When connecting two nouns in a sentence, `と` most commonly translates to 'and'. 

However, in this context `と` cannot be used as widely as the English 'and': it cannot be used to connect phrases or clauses within a sentence. 

But, if you want to say something like 'I like Japanese food and Italian food', you'd be correct to use `と`

> [日本の料理とイタリアの料理が好きです。]()  
> I like Japanese food and Italian food.

## Using と to mean with
If you went somewhere, or are doing something with another person, you can express this by using the particle `と`. For example:
> [友達と買い物に行く。]()  
> I will go shopping with my friend.

#

In this context `と` always follows the noun you're doing something with; the syntax is opposite to the English.

## Using と to compare and contrast
When comparing and contrasting, you use the particle `と` after each of things you are comparing, for example: 

> [ピアノとギターと、どちらの方が好きですか。]()  
> Which do you prefer: piano or guitar?

#

## Using と to mark quotation
`と` is used to mark a quotation or thought, for example: 

> [彼は「愛してる？」と言いました。]()  
> He asked, "Do you love me?"
