# Supposed to be: はずです

If something *is* expected, supposed to be the case, or the norm, you can state this by using `はずです`. The past tense `はずでした` can be used to say something *was* expected or supposed to be the case.

## Using はずです

### With verbs
`はずです` is used following a verb in the plain form, for example:

> [彼は今頃はそこに着いているはずだ。]()  
> He ought to have arrived there by now.

### With i-adjectives
`はずです` is used following an i-adjective in the plain form, e.g.

> [面白いはずだ]()  
> Supposed to be interesting

### With na-adjectives
`はずです` is used following a na-adjective plus the kana `な`

> [綺麗なはずです]()    
> Expected to be beautiful

### With nouns
`はずです` is used following a na-adjective plus the kana `の`

> [イギリス人のはずです]()  
> Supposed to be British

## In the Negative
To state negative expectations, the word preceding `はず` can either be conjugated to its negative plain form, or `はず` can be modified using `がない`:

> [オスカーさんはレストランに行かないはずだ。]()
> I don't expect Oscar will go to the restaurant.

> [オスカーさんはレストランに行くはずがない。]()
> I don't expect Oscar will go to the restaurant.

## Notes
`はず` cannot be used to say that someone is supposed to do something because of duty, responsibility, obligation, law etc.

If using `はずでした`, the sentence that proceeds it is always in the present tense.

`はず` is not used if guessing or expressing probability, rather it is used to express expectations based on some prior knowledge.

`はず` is never used on its own and is always modified by the preceding sentence or demonstrative.

## Example Sentences:

> [プログラムは今頃もう始まっているはずです。だから、前半はたぶん観られないでしょう。]()
