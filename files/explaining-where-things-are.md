# Explaining Where Things Are

You bump into a frantic Japanese person. New to the city and late for a heist, he asks you frantically `銀行はどこですか。` 'Where's the bank?'.

Sure, you can give him vague responses with `ここ` / `そこ` / `あそこ`, but he's a man in need. How do you explain more precisely where the bank is?

## Useful Words

## Using these Useful Words
To use these words, this is the basic sentence structure:

> **X** は **Y** の **location word** です。

To your frantic stranger you might now say:

> [銀行は郵便局の隣です。]()  
> The bank is next to the post office.

There is one exception to this sentence structure and that is with the word `間`. To use `間`, the following sentence structure applies:

**X** は **Y** と **Z** の **間** です。

> [銀行は郵便局とカフェの間です。]()  
> The bank is between the post office and the cafe.

This is all very well, but what if the person you're talking to doesn't know where the bank or the cafe is? For that, you'll need to learn how to give directions.

## がある vs. がいる
Instead of ending sentences such as `銀行は郵便局の隣です` with `です`, you can also use `がある` for non-living things and `がいる` for living things, for example

> [郵便局の隣に、銀行がある。]()  
> Next to the post office is the bank.

## Example Sentences:
> [図書館は信号のすぐ向こうです。]()  
> The library is just over the traffic light.

#

> [熊本は福岡と鹿児島の間にあります。]()  
> Kumamoto is between Fukuoka and Kagoshima

#

> [神社の入り口に鳥居がある。]()  
> There is a torii at the entrance of the shrine.

#

> [ビルの前に警備員がいる。]()  
> There is a guard in front of the building.
