# Extending an Invitation with ませんか

One way of extending an invitation to someone in Japanese is to use the phrase `ませんか`, building on the [masen-form](verb-longformpresentnegative) of a verb. For example, you might want to say:

> [テニスをしませんか。]()  
> Shall we play tennis?

If you are wondering why the negative form is used, then the most helpful way of think of it as similar to the prosaic English, "shan't". 

Instead of inviting someone to play tennis with you by saying "shall we play tennis?", you could theoretically use the negative to invite someone by saying "shan't we play tennis?".

The difference between the English and the Japanese however is that in the Japanese, you can't use the positive masu-form to extend an invitation. Therefore, `テニスをしますか` would be incorrect.
