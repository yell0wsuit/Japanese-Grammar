# The Causative-Passive Form

The causative-passive from combines the causative and passive forms. It is used to create sentences along the lines of 'someone was made to do something by someone else'. For example:

> [弟はお父さんに歩いて帰らせられた。]()  
> My younger brother was made to walk home by my father.


## Conjugating the Causative-Passive Form
Verbs can be conjugated in two ways. One way is to conjugate the dictionary form of a verb to its causative form, and then conjugating the causative form into its passive form. However, this process is a little long winded, so we've outlined a quicker method of conjugation in the tables below.

### U-Verbs
For u-verbs that end with `す`, change the `す` to `さ` and add `せられる`, for example:

|Dictionary Form|Causative-Passive| 
|:--|:--|
|[押す]()|押させられる |
|[話す]()|話させられる|

For all other u-verbs, change the final kana from its u-line sound to its a-line sound and add `せられる`, for example:

|Dictionary Form|Causative-Passive|
|:--|:--|
|[書く]()|書かせられる|
|[買う]()|買わせられる|
|[泳ぐ]()|泳がせられる|

U-verbs not ending in `す` are sometimes shortened, and `せられる` becomes `される`, e.g. `書かされる`.

### Ru-Verbs
Take the dictionary form, drop the final `る` and add `させられる`

|Dictionary Form|Causative-Passive|
|:--|:--|
|[見る]()|見させられる|

### Irregular Verbs
|Dictionary Form|Causative-Passive Form|
|:--|:--|
|[する](1157170)|させられる|
|[くる]()|こさせられる|

## Using the Causative-Passive Form
The basic format of a causative-passive sentence is as follows:

> Topic は Maker に Verb

Where the Topic is the person being made to do something, the Maker is the person making the topic do something and the Verb is the action performed by the topic.

You will notice that the particle order is the opposite to that of the causative form, where the Causer is marked by the particle `は`.

> **Causative-Passive**: [私はお母さんにケーキを作らせられました。]()  
> I was made by my mother to make a cake.

#

> **Causative**: [お母さんは私にケーキを作らせました。]()  
> My mother made me make a cake.

## Get rid of the 私
If the topic of the sentence is `私`, the `私は` at the beginning of the sentence can be omitted as the `私は` is presumed. For example:

> [お母さんにケーキを作らせられました。]()  
> (I was) made by my mother to make a cake.

The 'Maker' can also be omitted from a sentence if there's no person in particular acting as the maker, e.g.

> [ケーキを作らせられました。]()  
> (I was) made to make a cake.
