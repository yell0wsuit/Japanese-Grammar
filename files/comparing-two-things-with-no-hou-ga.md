# Comparing Two Things with の方が

Direct comparison of two things in Japanese is made possible through `の方が`. 

This construct can be used in statements 'X is more-adjective than Y', or to ask questions 'which is more-adjective, X or Y?'

## Using の方が

### Making Comparisons
This is the basic format for using `の方が` in a sentence:

* **X** の方が **Y** より **adjective**

Where X possesses more of the adjective than Y. Adjectives need not be conjugated in any special way.

For example: 

1. [ラーメンの方がうどんよりおいしいです。]()
(Ramen is more delicious than Udon.)
2. [スキーの方がスノーボードより楽しい。]()
(Skiing is more fun than snowboarding.)

### Asking Opinions
The construct can also be used to ask someone to compare between two things and express their opinion on the subject. The basic format is this:

* **X** と **Y** と どっちの方が **adjective** ですか。

For example:

1. [自電車と地下鉄どっちの方が簡単ですか。]() 
(Which is easier, bicycle or subway?)
2. [ラーメンとうどんとどっちの方が安い？]() 
(Which is cheaper, ramen or udon?)

To answer questions like this, you can use the format in the 'making comparisons' section above, or shorten your answer like so.

* Q: [ラーメンとうどんとどっちの方が安い？]() 
(Which is cheaper, ramen or udon?)
* A: [ラーメンの方が安い。]() 
(Ramen is cheaper.)

## Giving advice
`方がいい` can be used a sentence ender to offer advice to someone, effectively saying 'this is the better course'. If using `方がいい` to give advice, beware conjugations. When the advice is in the affirmative `方がいい` follows a verb in its past, plain-form. If giving negative, the verb is conjugated to its present-tense, plain form.

* Affirmative: もっと水を**飲んだ**方がいいです。- You should drink more water.
* Negative: 毎日お酒を**飲まない**方がいいです。- You shouldn't drink sake every day.
