# Going from the Plain Form to the Masu-Form on the Fly

Though most Japanese students will encounter the masu-form before the plain-form (it is simpler to learn), there will come a time in your Japanese life where you will encounter a verb in the plain form and wonder how you turn it into the masu-form. Here's how:

## U-verbs (Group I)
To change a u-verb from the plain form to the polite form, first create the verb stem by changing the う-sound *kana* into its い-sound equivalent (`う → い`, `く → き`, `つ → ち`, `す → し`, etc.) Then add `ます`.

|Dictionary Form|Masu-Form|
|:--|:--|
|[書く]()|書きます|
|[読む]()|読みます|
|[泳ぐ]()|泳ぎます|
|[話す]()|話ます|
|[待つ]()|待ちます|

## Ru-verbs (Group II)
For ru-verbs, conjugation is even simpler. Simply take off the final `る` and add `ます`.

|Dictionary Form|Masu-Form|
|:--|:--|
|[食べる]()|食べます|
|[あげる]()|あげます|
|[疲れる]()|疲れます|
|[調べる]()|調べます|

## Irregular Verbs (Group III)
No rules here, just the two old irregular verbs to learn.

|Dictionary Form|Masu-Form|
|:--|:--|
|[する](1157170)|します|
|[くる]()|きます|

Once you've got these rules down, you'll be able to flip any verb from its dictionary-form to its masu-form. You can then conjugate further into the negative, past affirmative and past negative forms of the masu-form. 

The above examples all use verb stems. Learn more about [verb stems](verb-iform), here.
