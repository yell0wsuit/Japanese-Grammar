# Connecting Opposing Facts with のに

The conjunction `のに` is used to connect two statements that operate truthfully despite each other. 

An example of this in English would be, 'despite the restaurant's good reviews, the food was disgusting'. This sentence is made up of two statements that operate truthfully despite each other. 

`のに` plays the same role in Japanese that the word despite does in the above English sentence.

## Using のに
Below we have sentence A and sentence B.

> [A: 長野に雪がありません。]()    
> There is no snow in Nagano.  

#

> [B: 来週オスカーさんはスキーします。 ]()  
> Oscar will ski next week.

To link these sentences with のに, we must modify sentence A into the plain form as can be seen in the example below:

> [長野に雪がないのに、来週オスカーさんはスキーします。]()  
> Even though there is no snow in Nagano, Oscar will go skiing next week.

Below are the rules for modification:

### Verbs/I-Adjectives
If sentence A ends with a verb or an i-adjective, it should be conjugated to its plain form, before adding `のに`. In the case above, `ありません` is conjugated to `ない`.

### Nouns/Na-adjectives
If sentence A ends with a noun or a na-adjective, `な` must be added before `のに`, for example: 

> [学生なのに、お金がたくさんある。]()  
> Though I'm a student, I have lots of money.

Sentence B can conjugated as desired to provide the tense and appropriate politeness for the sentence.

## Example Sentences:
> [いっぱい勉強したのに試験に落ちた。]()   
> Even though I studied a lot, I failed the exam.

#

> [父は背が高いのに僕は低い。]()   
> Though my father is tall, I am short.

#

> [美味しいのにお腹が一杯で食べられない。]()   
> Despite it being delicious, I can't eat it because I'm full.
