# Using 人 to Count People

When counting people, you do so with the counter `人`. Counting people is pretty easy but there are two irregular counters you must remember. See the table below:

|Japanese|English|  
|:--|:--|
|[一人]()|one person|
|[二人]()|two people|
|[三人]()|three people|
|[四人]()|four people|
|[五人]()|five people|
|[六人]()|six people|
|[七人]()|seven people|
|[八人]()|eight people|
|[九人]()|nine people|
|[十人]()|ten people|
|[五十人]()|fifty people|
|[百人]()|one hundred people|

## Asking How Many People
If you want to ask how many people there are, you would use the question `何人ですか。`

However, the most likely time you're going to be asked 'how many people?' in Japan will be in a restaurant. Because they are serving customers and being extra polite, they won't use `何人ですか`, instead you'll hear `何名様ですか`.

## Saying How Many People
If you want to say how many people, take the counter e.g. `一人` and add the verb `います`, e.g `三人います`
