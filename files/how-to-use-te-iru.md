# How to use ている

If you see or hear `ている` used in a sentence, it usually means one of two things:

1. an action is currently happening, or in progress (a.k.a the progressive tense), or
2. an event that has happened in the past is connected to the present.

## Using ている
To use `ている`, you must first put the verb into its te-form before adding `いる`.

### Conjugations
|Dictionary Form|ている-form|
|:--|:--|
|[飲む]()|飲んでいる|  
|[教える]()|教えている|
|[勉強する]()|勉強している|
|[くる](1547720)|きている|

The `いる` of `ている` is a ru-verb and can be conjugated as such in to the polite form, te-form etc.

### Uses
As stated above, there are two main uses for using `ている`. In the case of actions currently happening, it can be used for sentences such as:

> [ベンさんは日本語を勉強しています。]()  
> Ben is studying Japanese.

#


> [今、みんあさんは食べています。]()  
> Now, everyone is eating.

#



It can also be used to describe your occupation, even if you are not literally doing the very action right now.

> [日本語を教えている。]()  
> I teach Japanese.

The second usage of `ている` is in the form of past events being connected to the present through the event's (or change in state) ongoing significance. An examples of this is being married: 

> [トミさんは結婚しています。]()  
> Tommy is married.

Though the action of getting married is in the past, the change of state (from single to married) is still significant today. Therefore `ている` is used to convey the ongoing state of change. You can see more examples of this below.

## まだ〜ていません
If you want to say that you've not yet done something, you can use the negative form of `ている` in the phrase `まだ〜ていません`

> [彼はまだケーキを作っていません。]()  
> He hasn't made the cake yet.

## Example Sentences:
> [テーブルに猫の足跡が付いている。]()
