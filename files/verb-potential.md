# The Potential Form

Verbs in the potential form are used to let the listener know that someone can or can't do something; literally whether they have the potential to do a verb. 

Conjugation of verbs into the potential form is similar in meaning to using the phrase `ことができます`, but slightly less formal. 

## Conjugating the Potential Form
As with all conjugations, patterns exist around each of the three verb groups.

## U-verbs
Take the dictionary form, and change the last kana from the う-line sound to the え-line sound. Finally, add `る`.  

|Dictionary Form|Potential Form| 
|:--|:--|
|[行く](1578850)|行ける|
|[会う]()|会える|
|[急ぐ]()|急げる|
|[話す]()|話せる|
|[買う]()|買える|

## Ru-verbs
Take the dictionary form, drop the `る` and add `られる`.  

|Dictionary Form|Potential Form| 
|:--|:--|
|[食べる]()|食べられる|
|[見る]()|見られる|

Adding `られる` to the end of each word is a bit of a mouthful, so many Japanese speakers shorten `られる` to `れる` when conjugating ru-verbs into the potential form. So if you hear `食べれる` instead of `食べられる`, don't be surprised, it means the same, though is considered slightly less polite.

## Irregular Verbs

|Dictionary Form|Potential Form| 
|:--|:--|
|[する](1157170)|できる|
|[くる](1547720)|こられる|

As with the examples in the ru-verb section, `こられる` can be a bit of a mouthful, and is sometimes shortened to `これる`.

## Further Conjugations
The potential form can be conjugated further to make it more or less polite, or to render it into the past tense. Once you have already conjugated into the potential form, here is how to conjugate further, using `行く` as an example. Once conjugated to the potential form, all verbs act as ru-verbs and so follow the same conjugation rules.

## Particles in the Potential
When using the potential form, particle rules differ slightly. If constructing a sentence that previously used `を`, for example `ひらがなを読む`, the particle `が` can also be used. This means both `ひらがなを読める` and `ひらがなが読める` are acceptable. 

When using the potential form of `する` (`できる`), the particle used is `が`.

Apart from `を`, all other particle usage remains the same. 

## Example Sentences:
> [駅にはバスで行ける。]()  
> You can go to the station by bus.

#

> [乗り越えられる]()  
It is possible to overcome.

#

> [できる限り早く]()   
> As soon as possible.
