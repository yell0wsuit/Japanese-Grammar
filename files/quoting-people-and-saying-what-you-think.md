# Quoting People and Saying What You Think

This lesson will teach you how to quote people, or to say that you think something, using the particle `と`.

## Quoting
If quoting what someone has said, the plain form is used followed by the phrase `と言いました` (X said).

When quoting someone, the sentence structure is as follows:

> Name **は** 「quote in plain form」**と** 言いました。

For example:

> [オスカーさんは明日雪が降ると言いました。]()  
> Oscar said that it would snow tomorrow

By conjugating `と言いました` you can change the form of the sentence into the polite form or plain form etc. The quoted section always remains in the plain form.

### と言いました vs. と言っていました
Both `と言いました` and `と言っていました` can be used to quote, with little difference between the two. While `と言いました` translates more directly to 'I said', `と言っていました` more closely resembles 'I was saying'. 

Quotes preceding `と言っていました` are often less direct quotations, more akin to the feeling of the original quote than the actual word content.

## I think 'X'
If explaining your thoughts on a subject, the plain form is used followed by the phrase `と思います` (I think), for example:

> [明日雪が降ると思います。]()   
> I think it will snow tomorrow.

By conjugation `と思います` you can change the form of the sentence into the polite form or plain form etc. The part of the sentence that explains what you are thinking always remains in the plain form.

## The particle と
When quoting and saying what you think, the particle `と` effectively acts as the quotation marks you would find in an English sentence. The `と` particle acts to delineate between normal conversation and expressing thoughts you've had, or things that you are quoting.

## Example Sentences:
> [彼は何と言いましたか。]()  
> What did he say?

#

> [「愛してる？」と言いました。]()  
> He asked, "Do you love me?"

#

> [両親は私に年寄りを敬うように言った。]()  
> My parents told me we should respect the elderly.

#

> [寝ようと思う。]()  
> I think I'm going to sleep

#

> [誰が勝つと思う？]()  
> Who do you think will win?

#

> [大きすぎると思います。]()  
> I think that it's too big.
