# Describing Physical Attributes

In English, it’s natural to describe someone's physical attributes as follows:

* Oscar’s eyes are blue.
* Alice’s hair is blonde.
* Tommy’s waistline is expanding. 

Following a similar logic in Japanese you would create sentences such as:
* オスカーさんの目は青いです。- Oscar’s eyes are blue.

Where *Oscar’s eyes* are the topic and they are described as blue.

However in Japanese, this sentence sounds unnatural. A more natural sentence would read:
* [オスカーさんは目が青いです。]() - Oscar’s eyes are blue.

Where *Oscar* is the topic, and his eyes are described as blue. This pattern is used when describing any other physical attribute of a person in Japanese.
