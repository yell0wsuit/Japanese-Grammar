# Adjectives: The Plain Form Non-past Affirmative

## I-Adjectives
The plain, non-past affirmative of an i-adjective is an i-adjective at its most basic. No copulas, no conjugations, simply the adjective in its plain form.

## Na-Adjectives
The plain, non-past affirmative of a na-adjective is similarly simple, and follows the same conjugation rules as nouns. To conjugate the adjective properly at the end of a sentence, add `だ`. 

If using the plain, non-past affirmative of a na-adjective to modify a noun, put `な` between the na-adjective and the noun, e.g. `きれいな人`.
