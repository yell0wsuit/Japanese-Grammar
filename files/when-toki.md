# When: 時

In Japanese, the word `とき (時)` is used to describe when something happens, for example: 

* 子供時たくさん甘いものを食べた。(When I was a child, I ate lots of sweets.)

`時` is used as follows: 

* Sentence A (time reference) + 時 + Sentence B (event)

Sentence A always ends in the short form, whether it is in the past or present, positive or negative. However, whether Sentence A is in the past or present can significantly influence the meaning of a `時` sentence.

## The different meanings of 時
If Sentence A expresses an action, the meaning of the sentence changes depending on what tense Sentence A and Sentence B are in.

If the verb in Sentence A and Sentence B takes place at the same time:

> [福岡へ行く時新幹線で行く。]()  
> When I go to Fukuoka, I go by bullet train.

#

> [福岡へ行く時新幹線で行った。]()  
> When I went to Fukuoka, I went by bullet train.

#

> [福岡へ行った時新幹線で行った。]()  
> When I went to Fukuoka, I went by bullet train.

If the verb in Sentence A is a verb of movement (行く, 来る, 帰る,):

> [福岡へ行く時ラーメンを食べるつもりだ。]()  
> Before I leave for Fukuoka, I will eat ramen.

#

> [福岡へ行った時ラーメンを食べるつもりだ。]()  
> When I arrive in Fukuoka, I will eat ramen.

#

> [福岡へ行く時ラーメンを食べ た。]()  
> I ate ramen before I left for Fukuoka.

#

> [福岡へ行く時ラーメンを食べるつもりだ。]()  
> I ate ramen after I arrived in Fukuoka. 

If the verb in Sentence A is not a verb of movement:

> [コーヒーを飲む時シャワーを浴びる。]()  
> I will take a shower just before I eat my meal.

#

> [コーヒーを飲んだ時シャワーを浴びる。]()  
> I will take a shower straight after I eat my meal.

#

> [コーヒーを飲む時シャワーを浴びた。]()  
> I took a shower just before I eat my meal.

#

> [コーヒーを飲んだ時シャワーを浴びた。]()  
> I took a shower just after I eat my meal.

## Notes:
* 時 sentences are not used to express conditionality, instead the tara-form conditional is used to create conditional when sentences. Read more about the tara-form, here.
* If the subject of Sentence A is different to the subject of the entire sentence, `は` is replaced with `が`, for example.

> [トミさんは私が日本語を勉強した時ビールを飲んだ。]()  
> Tommy was drinking a beer when I was studying Japanese. 

* If a na-adjective precedes `時`, `だ` is replaced with `な`. Similarly if a noun precedes `時`, だ is replaced with `の`.
* The particle に can be added after 時 to emphasise the time aspect of the sentence. 

> 子供の時にお菓子がたくさん食べた。]()  
> *It was when* I was a child, that I ate lots of sweets.
