# Say What You've Decided To Do Something with the Volitional-Form

In this lesson, you'll learn how to use the [volitional form](verb-volitionalform) with the verb `思う` to say that you've decided to do something. 

## Volitional + と思っています
Using this construct allows you to say what you've decided to do. To create it, conjugate the verb into its volitional form and then add `と思っています`. For example:

> [毎日ヨガをしようと思っています。]()  
> I've decided to do yoga every day.

`います` at the end of `思っています` is the polite form of the ru-verb `いる` and can be conjugated further as needed. 

## Volitional + と思います
Maybe you haven't decided the right course of action yet. But you're put on the spot game show style, and you have making a decision in the moment. 

In this case you want to use the volitional and `と思います` to express your split second decision, For example:

> [もっと運動しようと思います。]()  
> I'm going to get more exercise.

The differences between `と思っています` and `と思います` are only slight, but basically come down to how much prior thought you've put into the thing you've decided to do.

### Example Sentences:
> [毎日ヨガをしようと思っています。]()  
> I've decided to do yoga every day.
