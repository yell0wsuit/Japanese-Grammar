# Using でしょう

`でしょう` is used as a sentence-ender and is most commonly used to indicate that something is probable. It is one of those words that changes meaning subtly with tone and context, and can be used to infer that something might happen, is likely to happen, or is a near certainty.

## Conjugating でしょう

### Verbs and I-Adjectives
`でしょう` follows verbs in the plain form (dictionary form or ta-form) and i-adjectives in the plain form. 

> [あしたは雨が降るでしょう。]()  
> It's probably going to rain tomorrow.

#

### Nouns and Na-Adjectives
`でしょう` follows nouns and na-adjectives in the plain form, `な`, `だ` or `の` are all removed. 

## Using でしょう for Probability
Take the following sentence: 

> [あしたは雨が降るでしょう。]()  
> It's probably going to rain tomorrow.

You might be wondering what level of probability is inferred by this sentence. The meaning of `だろう` here is similar to the use of probably in English, i.e. there's a higher chance than not it will rain - above 50%. 

## Using でしょう for Suppositions
`でしょう` can be used to express strong feelings about a supposition. For example if you had told someone previously that a certain restaurant served delicious noodles, you might say the following when eating the noodles:

> [このラメんは美味しいでしょう？]()  
> This bowl of ramen is tasty, right?  (with an “I told you so” feeling）

#

This use of `でしょう` is basically a more pushy version of the sentence ender `よね` so can sound a bit overbearing if used regularly. 

`でしょう` can also be used on its own with the same connotation. For example:

> A: [いい天気ですね。]()  
> It's nice weather.

#

> B: [でしょう？]()  
> See? (as in "I told you so.")

## Questions with でしょう
でしょう or だろう are used to soften questions or to add an element of doubt. For example, instead of saying:

> [彼は病気ですか。]()  
> Is he sick?

You can soften the question by adding でしょう

> [彼は病気でしょうか。]()  
> I wonder if he's sick.

## でしょう + ね
`でしょうね` can be used to mean something along the lines of 'I bet'. This expression gives the impression that the speaker is thinking out loud, or agreeing to something, without necessarily have a strong feeling about it. 

> [イギリスに旅行したい人はたくさんいるんでしょうね。]()  
> I bet there are many people who want to travel to England.

## でしょう vs だろう
`でしょう` is considered polite, and it's more casual counterpart is `だろう`. However, `だろう` is most frequently used by men. Until you're familiar with the appropriate circumstances of using `でしょう` it is probably best to steer clear of `だろう`.
