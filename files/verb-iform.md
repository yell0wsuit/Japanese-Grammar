# Verb Stems

Japanese verb stems have all sorts of uses. They are a stepping stone between plain and polite speech, they are used to link verbs together to create new constructs, and can even be combined with verbs to create new verb compounds.

## Conjugation
Conjugating the verb stem from the dictionary form is not difficult, but requires you learn the following rules:

### U-verbs (Group I)
To change a u-verb from the plain form to the polite form, change the う-sound *kana* into its い-sound equivalent (`う → い`, `く → き`, `つ → ち`, `す → し`, etc.)

|Dictionary Form|Stem|
|:--|:--|
|[行く](1578850)|行き|
|[思う]()|思い|
|[歌う]()|歌い|
|[歩く]()|歩き|

### Ru-verbs (Group II)
To create the stem of ru-verbs, simply remove the `る`.

|Dictionary Form | Stem |
|:--|:--|
|[食べる]()|食べ|
|[見る]()| 見|
|[覚える]()|覚え|

### Irregular Verbs (Group III)
|Dictionary Form|Stem|
|:--|:--|
|[する](1157170)|し|
|[くる]()|き|

## A Shortcut
If you already know a verb in its masu-form, simply remove the `ます` and hey presto, you've got the verb stem.

|Masu-form|Stem|
|:--|:--|
|[行きます]()|行き|
|[食べます]()|食べ |
|[します]()|し|
