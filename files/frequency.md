# Frequency

It's easy to express frequency in Japanese using the following construct:

> Period に frequency

Period is the length of time you're talking about e.g a week, a month, a year. Frequency is the number of times you perform that action in that period.

Frequency is marked by the counter `回`. 

A complete sentence would look something like this:

> [一週間に二回テニスをします。]()  
> I play tennis three times a week.

Where `一週間` is the period and `二回` the frequency.

> [兄は一月に三回福岡に行きます。]()  
> My older brother goes to Fukuoka three times a month.

## Interrogative
If you want to ask questions about frequency, the interrogative is `何回`, for example:

> [一週間に何回テニスをします。]()  
> How many times do you play tennis a week?
