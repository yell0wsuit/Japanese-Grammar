## Using ても
Take the following sentence:

> [雨が降っても、テニスをする。]()  
> I will play tennis even if it rains.

#

The above sentence is comprised of two halves `雨が降る` and `テニスをする`. `ても` is used to link the two to mean 'I will play tennis even if it rains'. `ても` always follows the conditional part of the sentence. An English translation closer to the Japanese structure would be 'Even if it rains, I will play tennis.'
