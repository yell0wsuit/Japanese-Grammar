# Linking Sentences with たり

There are multiple ways to link sentences in Japanese, and one of the most common ways is to use the [te-form](linking-together-activities-te-form). Here, we introduce `たり`, a more advanced way of linking sentences.

## て vs たり
Both link sentences, so what's the difference? If you link a sentence with the te-form, there is an implication that what you are saying are the only things that were done, or will be done. Take the following sentence:

> [福岡で海で泳いで、宝満山に登ります。]()  
> In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, and climb Mt Homan.

This translates to, 'In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, and climb Mt Homan.' Using `て` here to link sentences implies these are the only activities you are going to do in Fukuoka.

If you plan to do more, but only want to give a couple of examples, use `たり`. 

## Using たり
The basic format of a sentence using `たり` is this: 

Verb 1 **たり** Verb 2 **たり + する**

If we rework the sentence above so that it uses `たり`, it would read so:

> [福岡で海で泳いだり、宝満山に登りたりします。]()  
> In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, climb Mt Homan (amongst other things).

This now translates to, 'In Fukuoka, I will swim in the sea, climb Mt Homan (amongst other things).'

## Conjugating to たり
To use `たり` with a verb, conjugate the verb to its [ta-form](verb-shortformpastaffirmative) and then add `り`. To provide the tense of the sentence, conjugate the `する` after the final `たり`.

Adjectives can also used by adding `り` to the adjectives short-form past tense, e.g. 大きかったり高かったりする。

## Alternate meanings
The `たり` construct can also be used to say 'sometimes', for example:

> [あのスーパーの果物は新しかったり古かったりする。]()   
> That shop's fruit is sometimes fresh and sometimes old.

## Example Sentences:
> [明日は英語を見たり、買い物したりする。]()  
> I will go to shopping (and so on tomorrow.)
